# bootstrap-portfolio

In this assignment, we were tasked with creating a responsive portfolio page using mainly bootstrap. Just like our initial portfolio page, it had to have working links to a portfolio page which had a panel with every project we've done, as well as a link to a contact page that had a contact form. Every page had to have links to social media websites, and a footer, and navigation bar on every page.
